# theft-report
This application allows students of the Icesi university to submit reports in which they describe a suspicious individual or a suspicious
event taking place somewhere in the university.
This with the intent of protecting students from getting robbed of their precious belongings and overall promoting a community that 
doesn't allow this kind of behaviour by reporting it accordingly.
